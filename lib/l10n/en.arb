  "textAboutMe": "I am Álvaro López García, a programming analyst with nearly two years of experience in developing applications and technological solutions. I am currently completing my studies in Telecommunications Engineering, specializing in Telematics. My passion for technology and curiosity drive me to constantly explore new programming languages and areas of work.\n\nI have participated in significant projects, such as the development of a GMAO maintenance manager marketed at AlmaGMAO. I have experience in front-end programming using Flutter, Groovy, and Kotlin, and in back-end development with Django, PHP, and SQL. Additionally, I have developed web and desktop applications with HTML, Python, and Java.\n\nI consider myself a versatile, perfectionist, and dedicated individual with a strong ability to work in a team. I have collaborated in teams of five people, coordinating tasks and supporting interns in the front-end area. I approach challenges calmly and am not easily overwhelmed by pressure or stress.\n\nI strive to grow professionally every day by providing innovative and efficient solutions. I value a healthy and positive work environment. I keep myself updated in the industry through personal projects and by following technological advancements. I am willing to relocate or travel if necessary. My philosophy is: \"Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.\""
